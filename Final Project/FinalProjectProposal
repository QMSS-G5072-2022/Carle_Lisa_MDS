Name of project: LisasConcertFinder

Type of project: API Client (A) 

Brief description of the purpose: The purpose of this package is to search for an artist, and find concerts for that artist or artists related to that artist in cities across America.

Links to data sources / API etc.: 
https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/operations/get-an-artist
https://developer.ticketmaster.com/products-and-docs/apis/discovery-api/v2/#search-events-v2

Authentication: Both APIs require registration and API keys

Outline the technical steps / challenges you plan to address and include in your submission:
I will have the user enter an artist name and city, and then using the Ticket Master Event Search Get request, I will use the artist name and city to search for events.  This request will return information about an event, if there is one. If there is an event, I will also use the Get Artist request from the Spotify API to return information about the artist. 

If the artist is not having a concert in that city, I will use the Spotify Get Artistâ€™s Related Artists to find a related artist. Using the returned related artists function, I will use the Ticket Master Event Search Get request to return concerts in that city for the related artists. I will also use the Get Artist request from Spotify to return information about the related artists.  

Are there any significant hurdles that you have doubts about? Would not solving them render the project incomplete?: I am nervous about connecting to two different APIs, and using information from one to get requests from the other.
